direct=y if we use this parameter the DW(Data Pump Worker Process) will directly copy the buffers from the datafile otherwise buffers will first copy 
to the database buffer cache and from there it will write to dumpfile, So it will unnecessarily use the database instance and the performance will
be impact.


DW(Data Pump Worker Process) -> The Data Pump worker process is responsible for performing tasks that are
 assigned by the Data Pump master process, such as the loading and unloading of metadata and data.
 
 
Enable Archivelog Mode
===================================================================
SQL> select log_mode from v$database; / SQL> archive log list;

alter database mount;
alter database archivelog;
alter database open;


[oracle@oracledb ~]$ rman target /
RMAN> show all;
RMAN> CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP ON;  [spfile + control file + data file ]
RMAN> backup database plus archivelog;

SQL> show parameter spfile;
SQL> show parameter control;
SQL> select name from v$datafile;

RMAN> backup database plus archivelog;
RMAN> list backup of database summary;

We deleted all the files of database [spfile + control file + data file] 

Steps to recover:
1. Restore from full backup  [Full Backup = spfile + control file + data file ]
2. Apply archivelog files
3. Apply redo log files if any
4. Open the database

Nomount - spfile
Mount - control files
Open - Archives + RL + DF

[oracle@oracledb ~]$ rman target /
Will show error because the spfile is missing and for [target /] it is looking for the database which is set on env variable. When it is trying to connect 
to the database it is also looking for the control file.

[oracle@oracledb ~]$ rman   [We are connect to the rman utility not to the database]

RMAN> STARTUP FORCE NOMOUNT;
-- RMAN-06171: not connected to target database
RMAN> exit

[oracle@oracledb ~]$ sqlplus / as sysdba
Connected to an idle instance.

SQL>  startup nomount;  [As spfile is missing it will look for pfile [init+dbname.ora] if pfile also missing copy init.ora , see the errors and comment the unnecessary file location]

Also can create init.ora from alert log file by copying the file locations.
