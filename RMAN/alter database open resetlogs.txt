What resetlogs will do?
==========================================================================
Reinitializes the control file metadata about online redo logs and redo threads.

Updates all current datafiles and online redo logs and all subsequent archived redo logs with a new RESETLOGS SCN and time stamp.

Create new redolog files at OS level (location and size will be taken from controlfile) if not already existing

Resets the log seq number (LSN) to 1, 2, 3 etc for the created files

Whenever database is opened with resetlogs option, we will say database entered into new incarnation. 
If database is in new incarnation, the backups which were taken till now are no more useful. 
So, whenever we perform an incomplete recovery we need to take full backup of database immediately.

We can find the prev incarnation information of a database from below query
SQL> select resetlogs_change#,resetlogs_time from v$database;


alter database resetlogs is always required when:
- restoring from a backup controlfile (it does not have information about latest SCN)
- incomplete recovery (you cannot use current redologs or redo logs are unavailable)



SQL> alter database open resetlogs;  


At incomplete recovery the controlfile is not in sync with the datafile headers.
What does resetlogs do, apart from resetting the log sequence to 1 (so it does not reset the SCN to 1):

Sync the controlfile with the datafile headers!!!!
If you wouldn't do that, you wouldn't even be capable to open the database, as controlfile and datafile headers should always be in sync.
